# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
This project was part of the "Introduction to Reinforcement Learning" course at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt.

## Project description
Inventory management deals with the questions on when to order, in which quantity, potentially even from which source (supplier) 
to balance availability and costs. The main challenge in inventory management consists in dealing with changing demands, varying 
lead times, and / or disruptions. There are many different specific problem settings in inventory management 
(e.g., single vs. multiple supplier, fixed reorder vs. variable reorder quantity, etc.). Therefore, the objective was to work on 
an implementation of the Q learning reinforcement learning algorithm in an inventory management scenario, which is a typical 
application area in supply chain management. The file *RL_inventory_management_groupwork.pdf* contains the report, which 
describes the problem setting, the data generation process, an outlook on extending the model to DQN, as well as the results and 
a discussion. The implementaion is visible in the *inventory_beer_game_implementation.ipynb* file.
